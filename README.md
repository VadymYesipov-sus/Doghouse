# **Doghouse Web API Project - Practice & Learning**

## Project Overview
This project is a Web API designed primarily for practice and skill improvement. The main focus was on implementing common best practices such as pagination, query objects, filters, and middleware configuration. During development, I followed key software principles like SOLID and RESTful design to ensure the API is well-structured, maintainable, and scalable.

## Key Features
### Pagination: 
Implemented pagination to efficiently handle large datasets and improve response times for users requesting lists of resources.
### Query Objects: 
Used query objects to manage filtering, sorting, and searching of resources in a flexible and reusable way.
### Custom Filters: 
Applied custom filters for validation and request handling, ensuring proper data flow and security in API endpoints.
### Middleware Configuration: 
Configured middleware for various purposes, including error handling, logging, and authentication.
### SOLID Principles: 
Refactored the code following the SOLID principles to ensure the codebase is scalable, maintainable, and easy to test.
### RESTful API Design: 
Followed RESTful principles to design endpoints that are intuitive, stateless, and properly utilize HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
## Technologies Used
### **Backend:**
ASP.NET Core Web API
Entity Framework Core
SQL Server
SQL Server Management Studio
### **Error Handling:**
Custom middleware for error handling and response formatting
### **Testing:**
NUnit and XUnit for unit and integration testing
Features & Functionality
### **CRUD Operations:**
Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations are implemented following standard RESTful API conventions.
### **Filters:**
Custom filters for validation, ensuring incoming requests meet expected formats and data types.
### **Middleware:**
Middleware setup includes limiting rate of API calls and error handling ensuring the API is secure and robust.
## Lessons Learned
### Pagination and Query Objects: 
Improved understanding of how to implement flexible querying and efficient pagination in APIs.
### SOLID Principles: 
Gained practical experience in applying SOLID principles to create a well-structured and maintainable API codebase.
### RESTful Design: 
Learned to follow RESTful conventions for building clean, stateless, and predictable API endpoints.
### Middleware: 
Configured middleware for various concerns such as error handling, logging, and authentication.
## Conclusion
This Web API project has been a great opportunity to improve my skills in building RESTful services, applying best practices, and following key software principles. It serves as both a learning tool and a foundation for future projects. I'm looking forward to expanding the project and continuing to learn and grow as a developer.
